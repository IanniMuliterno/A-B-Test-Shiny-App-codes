# Documentation:

A/B Test is an application to determine if the difference in conversion rates between Control and Test web pages is statistical significant (that is, the difference are not due to random chance).
 
User should provide:

* Number of visitors to the control web page
* Number of visitor to the Test web page
* Number of conversion (Control page)
* Number of conversion (Test page)
* Significance level (%)

Here conversion means the number of visitors that ends up into the particular goal of the web page 
(as becoming a new user or buying a product, etc).

The Application will provide:

* A plot of the conversion rates for the Control and Test web pages
* Results from the statistical analysis. 
    - p-value 
    - Significance level 
    - Answer to the question: is the difference statistical significant?. Here we also provide a recommendation to the user. 

Later we will provide the option to read a file with the data from your web page. Check for a future release of this application.
